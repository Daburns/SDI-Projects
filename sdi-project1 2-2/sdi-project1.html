</p>Hello everyone </p>
</p>This was a very challenging week for me both personal and academically. The week started out fine as far as homework but time constraints in my work kept me from putting<p>
</p>in the time this week. My days this week broke down to 15 hours at work 4 hours for eating, homework and family time the rest those few 5 hours for sleep. <p>
</p>So I can get up and do it all over again. The strings functions and return values were a little rough but I did get to work some out.<p>
</p>I did not get a chance to complete the rest of my code for this but I thank you for tuning in and watching. Everything Ive learned this week that</p>
</p>I could not finish I plan on working through and completing next week.</p>
